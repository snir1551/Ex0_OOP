This project is about an unweighted and undirected graph that is a set of vertices and edges which connect the vertices, edge is actually neighbor vertex of this and this is actually neighbor of the vertex.

in this project we have three classes: NodeData, GraphDS, GraphAlgo.
for each of the classes we have interface, 
for NodeData class we have node_data interface
for GraphDS class we have graph interface
for Graph_Algo class we have graph_algorithms interface

class NodeData: He builds a vertex that for each vertex he builds he gives a unique key and preserves all its neighbors' vertices
class GraphDS: builds the graph from vertices, and by neighbors creates edges
class Graph_Algo: this class does all the complex calculations in the graph

Example of an unweighted and undirected graph:
